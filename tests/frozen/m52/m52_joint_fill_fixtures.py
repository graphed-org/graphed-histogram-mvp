"""Shared fixtures for the m52 joint-point fill anchors (§5.1 / C5).

Self-contained: the sibling m48/m49/m50 helper dirs are not on `pythonpath`, and the whole
`tests/frozen` tree is collected in ONE pytest process, so the `m52_` prefix is what keeps this
module from binding — or being bound as — another milestone's helper.

The program is the single-carrier shape §4.11-4 admits: a `jes` SHIFT registered on the event
context, then a `btag` WEIGHT family whose members are computed over the SHIFTED jets. That
dependency is what makes the family fan out: `graphed.vary` mints the full `jes` x `btag` grid, so
the two-coordinate universe `{btag: hf_up, jes: up}` exists under the machine label
`btag_hf_up__jes_up` with no tag of its own. A `points=` PLACEMENT entry selects that one joint and
prunes its siblings, leaving the one-at-a-time union untouched.

`btag_hf_up` and the joint come from the same `hf_up` member expression re-resolved at each `jes`
coordinate, so their ambient WEIGHT members are already DIFFERENT nodes. An executed inequality
between the two labels therefore does not separate a correct axis-value resolution from one that
kept nominal kinematics — C5 has to be read off the axis-value member structurally.

The oracle is eager awkward: each universe is `(jes scale, SF coefficient)`, and a JOINT row carries
BOTH coordinates. `test_joint_fill_resolution` validates the oracle against the unpruned grid in the
same run before leaning on the pruned program's joint row.
