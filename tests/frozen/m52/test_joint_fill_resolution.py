"""m52/C5 — §5.1: the axis-value member a fill uses for a label is the one that label's POINT names.

The fill lowering re-implemented the fallback rule privately: it string-tested the label against the
operand's own label list before touching an accessor, so a joint label the operand does not carry
reduced to the operand's nominal member no matter what its point said. The joint universe then got a
JES-up-evaluated b-tag SF applied to JES-NOMINAL kinematics — a silent wrong number, not an error.

Two anchors, one discriminating pair. The joint label's axis-value member must be the SHIFTED one;
the b-tag-only label's must stay NOMINAL. A resolution that simply prefers the newest or the
most-derived member passes the first and fails the second.

Both legs are asserted: the recorded axis-input node id, as a RELATION between the two named
candidate members (never a pinned integer — node ids are fixture-dependent), and the executed bin
contents against an eager awkward oracle validated over the whole fanout in the same run.
