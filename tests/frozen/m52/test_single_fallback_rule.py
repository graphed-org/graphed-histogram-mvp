"""m52/C5 — §5.1/§8-h: this package holds no second implementation of the fallback rule.

`graphed_histogram` re-implemented "the member this label names, else nominal" privately, so a
point-aware resolution in `graphed` could never reach the fill lowering. The rule has exactly one
implementation after C5, and it lives behind `graphed.member_of`.

A grep that finds nothing is indistinguishable from a grep that never ran, so the null leg carries
both its controls in the SAME test. The MATCHER control puts one-line files the test writes itself
through the identical matcher, one line per alternation branch — no edit to either source tree can
silence it, and a branch that had gone dead would show up as a missing hit rather than as a quiet
empty result. The BEHAVIORAL control asserts the surviving implementation still answers the
fallback, which the rule cannot lose without losing the resolution property this milestone rests on.

The control is deliberately NOT a spelling in `graphed`'s own source: this milestone rewrites the
canonical `_member_for`, and a source-spelling control there would redden a frozen test in this
repository for a legal implementation, invisibly to its owner. The tree is resolved from
`graphed_histogram.__file__` — the editable install points at the real source — never a path literal.
