"""m52/C5 — §5.1/§6.2: sibling mode and axis mode resolve a joint label by the same rule.

The private fallback rule had SEVEN call sites: one session read, three for the sibling-mode fill
(axis value, weight factor, `sample=`) and the same three again for the axis-mode fill. Routing only
the sibling branch through the point-aware accessor leaves the axis-mode sites on the old rule, and
the joint bin is then wrong in one mode and right in the other — which per-universe equality between
the two modes is exactly what catches. It is also what carries diff coverage over both branches.

Axis mode collapses weight-borne labels into one loop node against a FIXED axis column, so the joint
label — borne by the ambient b-tag weight — has to leave that loop (or the loop has to group by
resolved member) for its shifted kinematics to reach the fill at all.

Parity alone would also be satisfied by two identically-wrong modes, so each mode is separately
witnessed to resolve the joint's axis value to the shifted member before the two are compared. That
witness has to be STRUCTURAL: the joint's ambient b-tag weight is already a different node from
`btag_hf_up`'s, so the executed inequality between those two labels holds even when the axis value
wrongly resolves to nominal.
