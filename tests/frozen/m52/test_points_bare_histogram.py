"""m52/C4 — §4.10: `graphed.points()` refuses a bare axis-mode histogram.

Points are a record-time fact. They are not carried on disk, and a label cannot be parsed back into
a point, so an executed histogram carrying a `"variation"` StrCategory axis has label strings and
nothing else. Answering `{label: {}}` there would assert that every executed universe is the origin
— a wrong answer dressed as an introspection result, which is why the refusal is the property.

The refusal needs its own control: an implementation that raises on everything would pass it. The
record-time half of the same program is asserted to answer, in the same file, with the two
coordinates the fanout mints the joint from.
