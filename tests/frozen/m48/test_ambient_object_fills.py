"""m48/H6 — §6.1d: register-then-forget, completed at the fill.

`fill` reads its inputs' context handle and auto-applies that context's ambient weight, so a plain
Jet-pT fill yields the pileup universes with zero per-fill bookkeeping — the owner's simultaneity
requirement. The value is passed UNFLATTENED (`h.fill(sel.Jet.pt)`, never `gak.flatten(...)`,
which destroys the structure there is nothing left to broadcast against), and the frontend records
a broadcast-to-value-structure seam for EVERY weight factor it applies: the ambient one and each
explicit `weight=[...]` entry alike, since the evaluator flattens each input independently and
multiplies after flattening.

The trigger for that seam is a DISJUNCTION (§6.3(2)) — a context handle, any `Varied` input, or a
weight whose recorded FORM sits at a different row space than the value's — so the
contexted-but-unvaried fill and its context-free twin are cases of their own, asserted here with a
witness that the seam node was really recorded rather than the reference agreeing by accident.

This file also carries the three fill-shaped label-set assertions that §10/m48's §2.6 bullet
routes to `graphed-histogram`: asserting a fill's label set needs `Histogram.fill`, which no
`graphed` tree may import.
