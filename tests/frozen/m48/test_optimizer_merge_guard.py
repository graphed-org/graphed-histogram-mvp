"""m48/H5 — §7.2: the two ways two labels can collapse onto one node, and the two answers.

RECORD-TIME collapse (§1.2) is SUPPORTED: two labels whose members are structurally identical
intern to one node id, and the result carries BOTH keys off one evaluated fill — the frontend owns
`(output, label) -> node id` and derives the position as the rank in the DEDUPLICATED id list, so
many labels may resolve to one position and the unpacker replicates that value.

OPTIMIZER collapse is REFUSED. The M4 reducer also merges DISTINCT record ids (`x * 1.0` is an
identity token), so two fills differing only in `weight=[w]` versus `weight=[w * 1.0]` record two
nodes and compile to ONE output. The sound key — the record-to-reduced map — does not exist until
m49, so m48 refuses rather than mis-slicing; a mis-slice surfaces as an opaque worker-side
`IndexError`. The guard's SITE is the group-plan builder, not `compile_ir` and not
`aggregate_plan`, and it fires over a VARIED program only.

§1.1's stringified-float families make `points={s: w * float(s)}` — which contains a literal
`w * 1.0` member — a natural spelling, which is why this is guarded rather than documented.
