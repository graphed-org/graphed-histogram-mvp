"""m50 — §6.2 axis-vs-sibling equality: weight labels collapse into one histogram.

An opt-in per-`fill()` mode lands weight-label variations in ONE histogram carrying a pre-declared
`"variation"` StrCategory axis via an evaluator-side loop, while shift and `sample=` labels stay
sibling fills targeting that same axis. The result equals the frozen SIBLING-mode decomposition
label-by-label — the sibling lowering (m48/m49, eager-referenced) is the oracle. The value is
per-object and the weight factor per-event, so §6.1d's broadcast seam is genuinely engaged.

These anchors exercise source that does NOT ship at the m50 baseline (the axis-mode opt-in), so
each FAILS today at the opt-in keyword and passes once H1/H2 land.
