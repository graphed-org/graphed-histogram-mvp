"""The deferred ``boost_histogram.Histogram`` — fills RECORD; runners aggregate.

Each ``.fill(...)`` records one step the runner performs later, recorded the same way a
correction lookup or an ONNX model evaluation is; its evaluator returns a FILLED boost histogram
for one chunk. The step's identity is the content hash of the canonical axes/storage spec plus
its inputs, so identical fills collapse to one. Evaluation is graphed's own machinery — there is
no ``compute()`` here: ``plan()`` exports a plan (one fill task per partition over a
``graphed.write.PartitionedSource``; the whole-dataset loader is never invoked) whose
tree-combine is native ``+``, and ANY runner's ``run(plan).value`` IS the aggregated histogram;
``session.materialize(fill_node)`` evaluates a fill on the spot. Int64 counts are exact under
any combine tree; float storages are reproducible per fixed-tree runner configuration.
